	<b>Abstract</b>: Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) integrate GWAS and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) datasets to discover candidate causal gene-trait associations. We integrate multi-tissue expression panels and summary GWAS for LDL cholesterol and Crohn's disease to show that TWAS are highly vulnerable to discovering non-causal genes, because variants at a single GWAS hit locus are often eQTLs for multiple genes. TWAS exhibit acute instability when the tissue of the expression panel is changed: candidate causal genes that are TWAS hits in one tissue are usually no longer hits in another, due to lack of expression or strong eQTLs, while non-causal genes at the same loci remain. While TWAS is statistically valid when used as a weighted burden test to identify trait-associated loci, it is invalid to interpret TWAS associations as causal genes because the false discovery rate for TWAS causal gene discovery is not only high, but unquantifiable. More broadly, our results showcase limitations of using expression variation across individuals to determine causal genes at GWAS loci.

	<b>Abstract</b>: While stochastic variational inference is relatively well known for scaling inference in Bayesian probabilistic models, related methods also offer ways to circumnavigate the approximation of analytically intractable expectations. The key challenge in either setting is controlling the variance of gradient estimates: recent work has shown that for continuous latent variables, particularly multivariate Gaussians, this can be achieved by using the gradient of the log posterior. In this paper we apply the same idea to gamma distributed latent variables given gamma variational distributions, enabling straightforward "black box" variational inference in models where sparsity and non-negativity are appropriate. We demonstrate the method on a recently proposed gamma process model for network data, as well as a novel sparse factor analysis. We outperform generic sampling algorithms and the approach of using Gaussian variational distributions on transformed variables.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Recently, we and several other authors have written about the possibilities of using stochastic approximation techniques for fitting variational approximations to intractable Bayesian posterior distributions. Naive implementations of stochastic approximation suffer from high variance in this setting. Several authors have therefore suggested using control variates to reduce this variance, while we have taken a different but analogous approach to reducing the variance which we call stochastic linear regression. In this note we take the former perspective and derive the ideal set of control variates for stochastic approximation variational Bayes under a certain set of assumptions. We then show that using these control variates is closely related to using the stochastic linear regression approximation technique we proposed earlier. A simple example shows that our method for constructing control variates leads to stochastic estimators with much lower variance compared to other approaches.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The fundamental aim of clustering algorithms is to partition data points. We consider tasks where the discovered partition is allowed to vary with some covariate such as space or time. One approach would be to use fragmentation-coagulation processes, but these, being Markov processes, are restricted to linear or tree structured covariate spaces. We define a partition-valued process on an arbitrary covariate space using Gaussian processes. We use the process to construct a multitask clustering model which partitions datapoints in a similar way across multiple data sources, and a time series model of network data which allows cluster assignments to vary over time. We describe sampling algorithms for inference and apply our method to defining cancer subtypes based on different types of cellular characteristics, finding regulatory modules from gene expression data from multiple human populations, and discovering time varying community structure in a social network.
